Simple Dungeon Room generator using Canvas2D for visualization.

Can create multiple rooms and the corridors are conected using A* algorithm

I'm using a simpliflied version of the A* algorithm from GeeksforGeeks

To visualize just open the make.bat file (it is safe, I think) it is needed MinGW 32 c++ installed
